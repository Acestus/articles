# Killpoint 1984

This movie had a lot of killing.

I did not like all of the violence.
It reminded me of Joker.
You are able to be in the mind of a killer. You might me cheering him on vicariously as he kills like human like is worth less than a well groomed poodle.

I got to see it commercial free by downloading it from torrent.

I would be interested in buying the VHS tapes. It takes more time and money. I do not have the VHS player setup.

Overall the acting was mid. It showed me how far precedural shows have come.
NCIS would do a much better job when it came to movies.
